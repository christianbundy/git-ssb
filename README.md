# git-ssb

Git repos on [secure-scuttlebutt (SSB)][ssb].

This package includes:

- A command line tool `git-ssb` for managing SSB git repos
- A git remote helper [`git-remote-ssb`][] for using `ssb://` URLs with git
- A web server [`git-ssb-web`][] for browsing repos locally

## Install

```
npm install -g git-ssb
```

## Usage

You can use a `ssb://` remote like any other git remote. A repo on SSB is
identified by a message ID. To create a new git repo on SSB, use the command
`git ssb create`. You can only push to SSB git repos that you created, not ones
created by other users.

## Examples

Publish an existing repo to SSB:

    cd repo
    git ssb create
    git push ssb

Clone a repo from SSB:

    git clone ssb://<msgId> repo

Fork a git-ssb repo you have already cloned:

    cd repo
    git ssb fork mine
    # edit and commit, then push changes:
    git push mine

Run the web server for browsing repos:

    git ssb web

## Configuration

As with [patchwork][], `git-ssb` reads the `ssb_appname` environment
variable when deciding what scuttlebot instance to connect to.
`git-ssb` also uses [git's config][git config] to get the appname if the
environment variable is not set. To make it so a repo only gets used in your
[testing environment][patchwork-testing], you can configure the repo as
follows:

    git config ssb.app_name test
